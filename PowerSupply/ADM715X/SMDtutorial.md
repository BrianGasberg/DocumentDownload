# SMT assembling tutorial of ADM715X PCB

Please trust me, SMT assembling can be very easy by using your kitchen oven. I believe you can make it. You will get a factory quality PCB assembly.

Here is the tutorial. It's fully approved by my self. I'm very glad to share it with you.

1. Solder paste is the most important thing to prepare. I recommended SMD291AX. 
   DigiKey P/N is: SMD291AX-ND or SMD291AX50T3-ND. Keep in mind don't use any lead-free solder paste.
