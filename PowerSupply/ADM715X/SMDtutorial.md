# SMT assembling tutorial of ADM715X PCB

By Ian Jin.  (  iancanada.mail@gmail.com  )

Please trust me, SMT assembling can be very easy by using your kitchen oven. I believe you can make it. You will get a factory quality PCB assembly.

Here is the tutorial. It's fully approved by my self. I'm very glad to share it with you.

1. Solder paste is the most important thing to prepare. I recommended SMD291AX. 
   DigiKey P/N is: SMD291AX-ND or SMD291AX50T3-ND. Keep in mind don't use any lead-free solder paste.

2. Use a needle to drop the solder paste on each SMD pad. 
You don't need to cover the whole pad. You just need to make it be able to touch and wet SMD pins of components. Separate the paste bridge between pins  by the needle if there is any. Don't worry about any left over, they will all be cleaned when the solder gets molten.  Please see the below picture for details.

3. Place all SMD components onto the PCB by a tweezers. It doesn't have to be aligned very well. They will also be moved to correct positions when the solder paste get molten.

4. Put the populated PCB into a aluminum cooking pan.

5. Set your kitchen oven to bake mode, pre-heat it to 280F or 138C.

6. When the pre-heat temperature reached, quickly put the cooking pan into the oven. Close the oven door.

7. Re-set the oven temperature to 380F or 193C immediately. The temperature will start to rise right away. It should take less than 8 minutes to reach the target temperature. 3 to 5 minutes would the good time range. Too long will damage the PCB.

8. Once 380F target temperature is reached, fully open the oven door, take the cooking pan out of the oven. Be careful don't shake the pan. Let it cooling down in the room temperature.

Now you get the fully SMT assembled PCB. No difference with those made by SMT factory,

Enjoy
